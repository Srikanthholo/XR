- Simple - Create a 'simple' topic using a 3D model and your unique media content. Viewers can move, rotate, and scale models while viewing video, audio and text information about the topic.

- Multi-Scene - For more complex topics, create a lesson using multiple scenes and 3D models. Add videos, images, text and audio to share your entire lesson in XR.

- 360 - Record a 360 video and add interactive 'hotspots' to show details about different points in the video, including 2D videos, images, audio, and text.

- Timeline - Import your timelines from previous versions of Timeline 3D and is the simplest way to create beautiful multimedia timelines.
